# NegBinomialModel
This is the code for the negative binomial regression model I developed for my thesis on disparities in community water systems' compliance with the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). My thesis compared the demographics of water systems with the number of SDWA violations received by those water systems. I used these scripts to explore and analyze the SDWA violation data. The negative binomial regression model helped me determine which variables have a statistically significant relationship with those violations.
